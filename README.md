# FSI Market Data

This repository contains a modular quantitative research toolkit developed to support model development, validation, and deployment within the investment ecosystem. It provides a shared foundation for quants, model validators, and technologists to collaborate on research workflows in a governed, production-aligned environment.  

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The `quant-lib` project enables quantitative teams to:
- Rapidly prototype and validate financial models in Python 
- Leverage consistent data structures and model interfaces
- Track model performance over time with MLflow
- Run workflows across sandbox, staging, and production environments

---

## 🚦 Environments

This repo supports development and deployment across three standardized environments:

| Environment | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Sandbox** | For exploratory development, prototyping, and experimentation by quantitative researchers. |
| **Staging** | Used by model validators and reviewers for formal testing, validation, and governance review. |
| **Production** | Stable environment for executing approved models with full data access and monitoring. |

Environment configuration is driven by environment variables and project structure. See [`docs/environment_setup_instructions.md`](docs/environment_setup_instructions.md) for more.

## 📄 Governance & Documentation

Refer to the docs/ directory for:

Methodology explanations

Model limitations

Assumptions tracking

Governance workflows

All production models must go through staging validation and be tagged for release.

## 👥 Contributors
This project is maintained by Quantitative Research and Model Governance teams, in collaboration with internal engineering partners.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer
This repository is intended for internal research and demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for public use or distribution. All models are subject to formal validation and approval before production deployment.
